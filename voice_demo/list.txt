Now I want to show this voice recognition project. 
This is the directory structure of my project. 
The voice source folder stores the voices recorded by different people, which are divided into 10-second files. 
I use the LBP algorithm to convert the sound into a spectrogram and store it in the voice images folder. 
And I enhanced the image data by using a combination of Gaussian noise and image cropping.

The first python file is used to record audio. 
Write your name here and click record. 
The program will automatically create a folder for you and save your continuously recorded sound as a 10-second segment.

The second python file is used to process the audio file. 
And save the processing results in the model folder.

The third python file is used to process and analyze the sound in real time and display the current speaker. 
I used a sliding window to process real-time sound data. 
The window size I set here is 5 seconds. 
Although the recognition accuracy is not very high now, I think using a sliding window is a very good idea. 
In the future, I will try to use deep learning to train some large models to improve the recognition accuracy.

The above is my project demonstration, thank you.
